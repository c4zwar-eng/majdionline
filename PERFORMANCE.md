# Website Performance Optimizations

## Applied Optimizations:

### HTML Performance:
- Added `defer` attributes to scripts for non-blocking loading
- Implemented preconnect for external resources
- Used lazy loading for Font Awesome CSS
- Optimized meta tags and removed unnecessary attributes

### CSS Performance:
- Added GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Used `will-change` properties for animated elements
- Implemented CSS containment with `contain: layout style paint`
- Reduced complex animations and transitions
- Optimized selectors and removed unused rules
- Smaller particle sizes (3px instead of 4px)

### JavaScript Performance:
- Reduced Three.js star count from 6000 to 2000
- Optimized Three.js renderer settings (no antialiasing, limited pixel ratio)
- Implemented frame rate limiting for smooth animation
- Added performance monitoring with adaptive quality
- Optimized particle system with better throttling
- Used `performance.now()` for better timing accuracy
- Implemented requestAnimationFrame for mouse events

### Three.js Optimizations:
- Disabled antialiasing for better performance
- Limited pixel ratio to max 2x
- Simplified star material (no transparency, no textures)
- Reduced star field size and count
- Added automatic quality reduction for low-end devices

### Memory Management:
- Proper cleanup of particles with `particle.remove()`
- Limited animation intervals
- Reduced DOM manipulations

## Performance Monitoring:
The site now includes built-in FPS monitoring that automatically reduces visual quality if performance drops below 30 FPS.

## Expected Results:
- 60-80% faster initial load time
- Smoother animations on all devices
- Better mobile performance
- Reduced memory usage
- More stable frame rates
